upload-by-email.pl
--

upload-by-email is a simple Perl script that parses an email containing a
photo attachment and sends it to Little Printer using the Direct Print API.

Photos are resized and converted to greyscale (and rotated if they are wider
than they are tall) and written to a user-defined folder that can be reached on
the Interwebs.

This means you'll need to have a website. You'll need to have a website on the
same machine that the upload-by-email handler is on (and can write files to).

This is not ideal but test messages sent to the Direct Print API containing even
small images encoded as data blobs always seem to make the BERG Cloud servers
cry so this will have to do for now.

It can be run from the command line or (more likely) as an upload-by-email style
handler or callback that you'll need to configure yourself.

For example:

	$> ./upload-by-email.pl -c littleprinter.cfg < ~/test.eml
